# Rumage

Rumage is a simple web framework. It converts Markdown files to plain HTML.

⚠️ Rumage is not fully production ready! It is pretty stable,
but it needs more error handling. You could use it, but keep
in mind that if you encounter an error, it might be harder
to troubleshoot. I use it for my [personal website](https://angelmario.eu)
